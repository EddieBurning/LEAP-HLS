LEAP-HLS
===========

Integrate HLS designs into the LEAP framework.

This repository contains code in support of the tutorial "The LEAP Run-time System â€“ Rapid System Integration of Your HLS Kernels", held at the International Conference on Field-programmable Logic and Applications 2015 (http://www.fpl2015.org/?page=tutorials#t4).

Current HLS systems typically provide very simple FPGA-side memory and I/O sub-systems. The LEAP operating environment provides composable components and services for connecting FPGA kernels to external memory sub-systems and for building hybrid implementations combining FPGAs and software. These code examples show how to integrate Vivado HLS designs into the LEAP environment and describe the interfaces through which the HLS-generated kernels are supported by cache-based, application-specific memory hierarchies.

Instructions for building the applications are in the README file in each folder.

This repository is currently under construction.
